# College Magazine - Online Magazine & News Portal

## 🚀 About The Project
**Kiet Magazine** was developed to solve the problem of scattered digital content. In a world where students and professionals have to visit multiple websites for news, research, and lifestyle reading, this project offers a **single, centralized hub**.

I built this project to demonstrate how frontend technologies (HTML, CSS, JS) can create a seamless, app-like experience in a web browser. It features a secure login gate, a responsive grid system that handles images perfectly, and a backend-free feedback loop using API integration.



## ✨ Key Features

### 1. 🔐 Secure Entry (Login System)
Access to the portal is restricted to authorized users. The landing page (`login.html`) acts as a security gate.
* **Authentication:** JavaScript-based validation.
* **Security:** Auto-redirects unauthorized users and shows error messages for wrong passwords.

### 2. 📝 Automated Feedback (SheetMonkey Integration)
We value user input! The **Feedback Page** is integrated with **SheetMonkey.io**, allowing users to submit suggestions directly to a Google Spreadsheet.
* **Backend-Free:** Connects HTML forms directly to Google Sheets.
* **Real-Time:** Submissions appear instantly in the admin sheet for review.

### 3. 📚 Categorized Content Library
* **Hero Section:** Features a transparent "Magazine of the Week" spotlight.
* **Grid Layouts:** Distinct sections for Latest, Weekly, and Monthly publications.
* **Uniform Design:** Uses `object-fit: cover` to ensure every magazine cover looks perfect, regardless of the original image size.
